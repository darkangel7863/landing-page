## Instructions

## Index.html

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Index.html

The Index.html file is containing the starter project with the markup added regarding only increasing the sections for the page 
. As well I added the <script> tags at the end of the body in order to load the Javascript correctly after page load. Also I added the Return To Top button .

## styles.css

Same as the starter pack except for a few changes . Mainly the Active class for the links in the Menu . Also the Back To Top Button style and It's hover state style as well .
